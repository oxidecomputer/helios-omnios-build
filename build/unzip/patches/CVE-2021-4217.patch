This is re-implementation of
https://launchpadlibrarian.net/580782282/0001-Fix-null-pointer-dereference-and-use-of-uninitialized-data.patch
into unzip 6.1beta c25
As can be seen in fileio.c:3326 patch is already implemented here but not in process.c

I will try to ask Steven Schweda (maintainer) why it is so.
