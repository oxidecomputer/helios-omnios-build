* Make the stack non-executable for 32-bit binaries.
* (64-bit binaries always have a non-executable stack.)

* The traditional (and essentially entirely brain dead) cfgadm(1M)-centric
* model of hotpluggin' appears to be basically unnecessary.  This tunable
* enables the system to create device nodes for newly inserted devices
* automatically.  See: usr/src/uts/common/io/sata/impl/sata.c:97

*
* We want to limit the time spent in any one I/O to 10 seconds for targets
* that are not optical.  This is still a very long time; our queue depth is
* typically 10 or less, and disks will usually fail a command after 2-3s.
* So we'd have to have multiple reads of bad sectors queued up to have any
* chance of timing out.  In practice, timeouts occur because of problems with
* disk controllers or firmware, not media errors, and in those cases it will
* not help at all to wait longer.

set sd:sd_io_time=10

*
* Use a higher system clock rate to improve scheduling
