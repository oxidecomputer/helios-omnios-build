# The format of this file is tab-separated fields as follows:
#
#	<pkg>	<flags>
#
# where flags can include:
#
#	F	- Add a facet to allow this line to be selectively disabled.
#	S	- Do not include this package in entire for sparse zones.
#	Z	- Do not include this package in entire for non-global zones.
#	O	- This is an optional package.
#		  Optional packages will be installed by default on new systems
#		  (i.e. will be part of the ZFS installation stream), but can
#		  be subsequently uninstalled. They will also be installed into
#		  newly created non-global zones iff they are installed in the
#		  GZ.
