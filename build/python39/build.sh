# In order to continue supporting packages from pkgsrc, libc was updated
# to include the new memrchr() function. This means that components such as
# python now depend on the newer library version. Force a specific minimum
# dependency here so that it is harder for a user to half update their
# system and end up with a broken `pkg`.
