Stable and Long-Term-Supported (LTS) Release, 3rd of May 2021

`uname -a` shows `omnios-r151038-adeb0c00cf`

r151038 release repository: https://pkg.omnios.org/r151038/core

## Upgrade Notes

Before upgrading, please ensure that your `package/pkg` package is up-to-date
by running `pkg update pkg`. The `pkg` software was recently updated for all
supported releases (r151030, r151032 and r151034) to properly handle
conditional dependencies which are more widely used in r151036. The new `pkg`
also has additional diagnostic output to help troubleshoot package updates.

The default `python` mediator version is now set to 3 instead of 2; this means
that `/usr/bin/python` is now Python 3. To restore the previous configuration,
change the mediator version - `pkg set-mediator -V 2 python`. Alternatively,
the `/usr/bin/python2` link continues to point at Python 2.

OpenJDK in OmniOS no longer enables the TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 protocols by default.

OpenSSH in OmniOS no longer provides support for GSSAPI key exchange. If you
require this feature, please [let us know](https://omnios.org/about/contact).

Upgrades are supported from the r151030, r151032, r151034 and r151036 releases.
If upgrading from before r151036, also refer to the following documents:

 * [Release notes for r151032](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151032/doc/ReleaseNotes.md#upgrade-notes)
 * [Release notes for r151034](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151034/doc/ReleaseNotes.md#upgrade-notes)
 * [Release notes for r151036](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151036/doc/ReleaseNotes.md#upgrade-notes)

## New features since r151036

### System Features

* ZFS has gained support for persistent L2ARC. This is automatically enabled
  for all layer-2 ARC devices.

* Support for one-time-boot to a new boot environment, with the
  `beadm activate -t` option. After rebooting the new boot environment,
  a subsequent reboot, crash or power cycle will revert to the original.

* System support for NVMe Hotplug.

* Userland packages are now built with extended protection against stack
  overflow bugs using the Stack Smashing Protector (SSP) compiler feature.

* The legacy OpenSSL 1.0 library is now shipped with weak ciphers disabled
  in order to protect against known security vulnerabilities.

* A number of improvements to the way that memory pages are scanned and
  paged out during low memory conditions have been incorporated in this
  release.

* The boot loader now has better support for multiple consoles, and initial
  output and menus will be displayed on each.

* The package manager has gained a new `pkg autoremove` command and others.
  See below for more information.

* A number of improvements and bug fixes to the in-kernel SMB/CIFS file
  sharing service have been integrated.

* A number of packages have been recategorised as `optional` which means that
  they are part of the default system installation, but can be removed if
  not required. The list of optional packages can be viewed using:
  ```
  pkg list -R
  ```
  and the optional system packages will show an `S` in the flags column.
  > If an optional package is removed from the global zone, then the package
  > will no longer be installed by default into any newly created non-global
  > zones.

* The system boot banner has been updated.

### Commands and Command Options

* The system shell, `/bin/sh` and `/bin/ksh` has been upgraded to _ksh93u+_.
  This fixes a number of bugs and improves standards compliance.

* Python has been upgraded to Python 3.9.

* The new `developer/exuberant-ctags` package is available, delivering a
  more capable version of `/usr/bin/ctags`. This is not installed by default.

* The `roleauth` user attribute has been added. This makes it possible to
  specify which password is required to assume a role - the password from
  the role account or the assuming user's password. See
  [user_attr(4)](https://man.omnios.org/user_attr.4) for more
  details.

* Command line completion information for the `bash` shell has been updated.

* [beadm(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/beadm.1m) has gained the `-t` and `-T`
  options for activating and de-activating one-time boot environments.

* [pkg(1)](https://man.omnios.org/pkg.1) has gained a number of new commands
  and options. Refer to _Package Management_ below.

* The [bhhwcompat(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/bhhwcompat.1m) utility has been
  re-introduced to determine whether a system supports the bhyve hypervisor.

### Libraries and Library Functions

* Support for the `IP_RECVTOS` socket option has been added.

* The [upanic(2)](https://man.omnios.org/upanic.2) system call
  has been added to terminate a process and generate a core file. This is
  an illumos-specific alternative to the `abort(3)` call which is used by
  the native stack protector. Refer to the manual page for more details.

* The [getgrouplist(3C)](https://man.omnios.org/getgrouplist.3c)
  function has been added to the C library.

* The [getcwd(3C)](https://man.omnios.org/getcwd.3c) function has been updated
  to support passing _0_ as the _size_ parameter. This improves support for
  running third party software that assumes this non-standard extension is
  available.

### Zones

* The [signalfd(3C)](https://man.omnios.org/signalfd.3c)
  function now works in non-global zones.

* The zone boot sequence has been streamlined so that zones boot faster,
  particularly when several are starting in parallel after system boot.

* The `max-processes` zone resource control is now documented and is set
  to match any configured `max-lwps` control if not explicitly set.
  See [zonecfg(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/zonecfg.1m).

* `illumos` branded zones now support boot environments; these are fully
  independant of the global zone's boot environments. To take advantage of
  this, any existing illumos branded zones will need to be re-installed,
  otherwise they will continue without BE support. The easiest way to do
  this is to snapshot and `zfs send` the old zone root, and then re-install
  it, for example, for an illumos zone called `zone1`:
  ```
  # zoneadm -z zone1 shutdown
  # zfs snapshot rpool/zones/zone1/root@migrate
  # zfs send rpool/zones/zone1/root@migrate > /tmp/zone1.zfs
  # zoneadm -z zone1 uninstall
  # zoneadm -z zone1 install -s /tmp/zone1.zfs
  # zoneadm -z zone1 boot
  ```

### LX zones

* The `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid` file is now available in an lx zone.
  Each read of this file returns a type 4 UUID as a string. The format of
  the ID returned from `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` is now a valid
  type 4 UUID.

* Some processes which relied on the system `RLIMIT_NPROC` parameter could
  crash on startup. This has been resolved.

* Emulation of the Linux-specific feature that allows a symbolic link to be
  opened as a file has been improved, resolving problems experienced with some
  software in lx zones.

### Bhyve

* Many improvements from upstream illumos and FreeBSD.

* Improved VNC support for the built-in framebuffer console. This now works
  properly with more clients, including native MacOS screen sharing.

* Improved emulated NVMe devices.

* Support for specifying pass-through devices in the zone configuration.
  See [bhyve(5)](https://man.omnios.org/bhyve.5) for more information.

* Support for attaching a virtio random number generator device through the
  `rng` attribute in the zone configuration
  (see [bhyve(5)](https://man.omnios.org/bhyve.5)).

* Improved automatic memory reclamation from the ZFS ARC when necessary to
  start a new bhyve virtual machine.

### ZFS

* Support for persistent L2ARC.

* Support for one-time boot environment activation.

### Package Management

* The `pkg list` command has gained some new flags:
  * `-r` shows removable packages. That is, those which have no dependants
    and could be removed if desired.
  * `-R` extends this by also showing the removable system packages, but with
    an `S` showing in the flags column.
  * `-m` shows packages which were manually installed, that is explicitly
    provided as arguments to a `pkg install` command. Manually installed
    packages show an `m` in the flags column.
  * `-M` shows the packages were **not** manually installed, that is those
    which are part of the default system or were automatically installed as
    dependencies for another package.

* A new `pkg autoremove` command has been added which automatically uninstalls
  any removable packages which were not manually installed (i.e. those packages
  listed with `pkg list -rM`). This command supports the same options as
  _uninstall_ - in particular, `pkg autoremove -nv` shows what would be done
  without making any changes to the system.

> Note that when upgrading to r151038 from an earlier release, the list of
> packages which were manually installed will be incomplete.
> This can be corrected by reviewing the output of `pkg list -rM` and using
> the `pkg flag -m` command to flag any packages that should not be considered
> by autoremove.

* Packages can be flagged as manually installed using the new `pkg flag -m`
  command. There is a corresponding `pkg flag -M` command which removes
  the flag.

* `pkg` has gained the `--temp-be-activate` option to use one-time boot
  environment activation when an update requires a new BE or one has been
  requested.

* A new system property has been added to make `--temp-be-activate` the default
  behaviour when a new boot environment is created as part of a package
  operation. This can be set with `pkg set-property temp-be-activation=True`.
  This option is useful for systems where console access is not readily
  available, since a power cycle will automatically revert to the previous
  boot environment.

* `pkg clean` can be used to manually remove cached downloaded content.
  This is useful when the _flush-content-cache-on-success_ image property
  has been set to _False_.

### Hardware Support

* Improved support for AMD Zen 3 CPUs.

* Added support for the Hygon Dhyana Family of processors.

* The X710 10GBaseT\*L Family if parts is supported.

* Support for chipset and CPU sensors has been extended.

* There have been several improvements in support for creating network link
  aggregations with a variety of network cards.

### Installer

* Support for searching for installation ZFS images on USB flash drives.
  This enables OmniOS to be installed from third party tools such as
  [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy).

* The hybrid _.iso_ image has been improved and works on more systems.
  If booting from a USB flash drive, this hybrid image should be used instead
  of the _.usb-dd_ file if possible.

* The [bhhwcompat(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/bhhwcompat.1m) utility is now
  available from the installer shell. This checks if the system supports
  the bhyve hypervisor.

### Virtualisation

* The `azure-agent` package has been upgraded and extended. It now has the
  ability to create users and provision SSH keys automatically during
  virtual machine deployment in Azure.

* A disk image suitable for using in Azure is available alongside this release.
  See <https://omnios.org/article/azure-image> for more information on how
  this can be used.

### Developer Features

* Almost all system binaries and libraries are now delivered with
  embedded Compact Type Format (CTF) debugging data and with the symbol
  table present. This increases observability by providing type data to
  `mdb`, `dtrace` and the kernel.

* A native stack smashing protection (SSP) implementation has been added to
  the standard C library (_libc.so_). The gcc compiler packages have been
  updated to use this implementation when building code with gcc's
  `-fstack-protector` option.

* The `-zassert-deflib` linker option did not work when building 64-bit
  objects; this has been corrected.

* The Compact Type Format (CTF) utilities delivered with the
  developer/build/onbld package have been updated and are able to more easily
  convert data in larger and more complex objects.

* The illumos `make` command now sets predefined macros to better values.
  For example, the `CC` variable is now `gcc` by default.
  See [make(1)](https://man.omnios.org/make.1#Predefined_Macros) for more
  details.

* The python package now includes the `pip` module, which can be invoked  via
  `python -mpip`. Python modules delivered via `pkg` cannot be uninstalled or
  replaced using pip.

* The perl _Sun::Solaris::Privilege_ and _Sun::Solaris::Ucred_ modules are now
  available in the `runtime/perl/module/sun-solaris` package. These allow
  perl programs to easily access the illumos privilege and user credentials
  features. See [privilege(3perl)](https://man.omnios.org/privilege.3perl)
  and [ucred(3perl)](https://man.omnios.org/ucred.3perl).

* OpenJDK now disables versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the TLS protocol by default.
  If you encounter issues, you can re-enable the versions by removing "TLSv1"
  and/or "TLSv1.1" from the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property in
  the `java.security` configuration file.

### Deprecated features

* OpenSSH in OmniOS no longer provides support for GSSAPI key exchange.

* Python 2 is now end-of-life and will not receive any further updates. The
  `python-27` package is still available for backwards compatibility but will
  be maintained only on a best-efforts basis. `/usr/bin/python` points to
  Python 3 by default. Use `/usr/bin/python2` to start the legacy version,
  or change the `python` mediator version.

* OpenSSL 1.0.x is deprecated and reached end-of-support at the end of 2019.
  OmniOS has completely transitioned to OpenSSL 1.1.1 but retains the OpenSSL
  1.0.2 libraries for backwards compatibility. The 1.0.2 libraries are
  maintained solely on a best-efforts basis.
